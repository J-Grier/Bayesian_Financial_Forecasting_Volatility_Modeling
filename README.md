# Bayesian Financial Forecasting & Volatility Modeling

## Overview
This project investigates statistical methods for forecasting financial market volatility, focusing on comparing classical (frequentist) and Bayesian approaches. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is used as the primary dataset and initial benchmark, with additional evaluation on Microsoft (MSFT) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Methods evaluated include ARIMA, Prophet, Bayesian AR(1), and Bayesian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

---

## Objectives
- Determine the most accurate short-term volatility forecasting model.
- Assess the effectiveness of Bayesian methods in capturing volatility regimes versus classical models.
- Evaluate the generalizability of Bayesian methods across different stocks.

---

## Methods and Models Evaluated
- **Classical Models**: ARIMA, Prophet (Facebook)
- **Bayesian Models**: Bayesian AR(1), Bayesian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

---

## Key Findings
### Bayesian AR(1) â€“ Best Short-Term Predictive Accuracy
- **Superior quantitative results** across multiple stocks without retraining:
  - AAPL: MAE = 0.0096, MSE = 0.0003
  - MSFT: MAE = 0.0101, MSE = 0.0003
  - JPM: MAE = 0.0089, MSE = 0.0003

### Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) â€“ Captures Volatility Regimes
- Explicitly identified macro-level market volatility regimes.
- Quantitatively less precise (MAE = 0.1564, MSE = 0.0377) but valuable for qualitative insights into volatility shifts.

### Classical Models â€“ Lagging Accuracy
- ARIMA(1,1,1): MAE = 0.0871, MSE = 0.0108
- Prophet: MAE = 0.1418, MSE = 0.0422

## Suitability & Limitations of Bayesian Methods
### Strengths:
- Explicit uncertainty quantification and credible intervals.
- Probabilistic modeling of market volatility and regime shifts.

### Limitations:
- Bayesian HMM has high computational complexity.
- Limited generalizability of HMM across multiple stocks.
- Assumption of linear dynamics in Bayesian AR(1).

---

## Future Directions
- Computational optimization of Bayesian HMM models (e.g., variational inference, Expectation-Maximization).
- Leverage advanced probabilistic frameworks (Pyro, TensorFlow Probability) for performance enhancements.
